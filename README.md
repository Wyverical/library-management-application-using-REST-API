# Building a Library Management System using REST API

Building a robust Library Management System API using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and JWT authentication. This guide explains each step in detailâ€”from cloning the repository and installing dependencies to running the application and testing the endpoints. Whether youâ€™re a beginner or an experienced developer, this step-by-step process will help you understand and implement a secure, scalable RESTful API for managing library operations.

## Introduction

The Library Management System API is a RESTful service designed to handle common library tasks such as user registration and management, secure user authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), book management (creation, retrieval, updates, and deletion), and tracking of book borrowing and returning transactions. With role-based access control, administrative endpoints are protected, ensuring that only authorized users can perform critical operations.

## Cloning the Repository

To get started, youâ€™ll need to clone the repository from GitHub. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or any terminal of your choice).
2. Run the following command to clone the repository (replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository):

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. Once the cloning process is complete, navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd library_management
   ```

## Setting Up the Environment

### Creating and Activating a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Execute the following commands:

- **Create a virtual environment:**

  ```
  python -m venv venv
  ```

- **Activate the virtual environment:**

  - On **Windows** (using PowerShell):

    ```
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

  - On **macOS/Linux**:

    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### Installing Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, install the necessary packages by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes all the pinned versions required for the project, ensuring compatibility. The key dependencies are:
- Flask 2.1.2
- Flask-SQLAlchemy 2.5.1
- Flask-JWT-Extended 4.4.0
- Passlib 1.7.4 (with bcrypt 3.2.0)
- Werkzeug 2.0.3
- SQLAlchemy (version below 2.0)

## Running the Application

To start the Library Management System API, execute the following command in your terminal:

```
python run.py
```

The server will start in debug mode and the API will be accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000). The root endpoint provides a simple confirmation that the API is running.

## Detailed REST API Endpoints

Below is an overview of the main endpoints available in the API.

  ]
  ```
  *Error Response:*  
  - 403 if the requester lacks admin privileges.

- **PUT /users/<user_id>**
